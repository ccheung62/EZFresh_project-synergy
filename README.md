# EZ Fresh
[EZ Fresh](https://ccheung62.github.io/EZFresh_project-synergy/) is the mock business idea we came up to make daily groceries easier and safer during the pandemic while supporting local supermarkets. <br>

## Problem 
- The ongoing pandemic has affected day-to-day tasks such as shopping for groceries. 
- Vulnerable groups such as elderly people are highly at risk but assistance rates are limited
    - Elders living alone have to buy food themselves
    - Many cannot travel to the supermarket
- Supermarkets have limited capacity
    - Local supermarkets are extremely populated in areas where there is less competition
        - Increased risk of becoming infected with COVID-19
- A lack of job opportunities 
    - Unemployment rate rose from 3.5% in February 2020, to 14.5% in March 2020
    - 314% increase in the national unemployment rate (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics) 

## Solution 
- A website and app that connects people with local supermarkets
- Provide customers, especially vulnerable population, with easy access to fresh produce
- Users could place orders via our website or on our mobile app from a variety of local supermarkets
    - Ensure everyoneâ€™s safety and minimize the risk of spreading the virus
- Create job opportunities to reduce the unemployment rate and enhance the economy
    - Food packaging within supermarkets
    - Delivery people within our company
- Help local small businesses
