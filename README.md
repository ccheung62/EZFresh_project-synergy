# EZ Fresh
[EZ Fresh](https://ccheung62.github.io/EZFresh_project-synergy/) is the mock business idea we came up to make daily groceries easier and safer during the pandemic while supporting local supermarkets. <br>

## Problem 
- The ongoing pandemic has affected day-to-day tasks such as shopping for groceries. 
- Vulnerable groups such as elderly people are highly at risk but assistance rates are limited
    - Elders living alone have to buy food themselves
    - Many cannot travel to the supermarket
- Supermarkets have limited capacity
    - Local supermarkets are extremely populated in areas where there is less competition
        - Increased risk of becoming infected with COVID-19
- A lack of job opportunities 
    - Unemployment rate rose from 3.5% in February 2020, to 14.5% in March 2020
    - 314% increase in the national unemployment rate (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics) 

## Solution 
- A website and app that connects people with local supermarkets
- Provide customers, especially vulnerable population, with easy access to fresh produce
- Users could place orders via our website or on our mobile app from a variety of local supermarkets
    - Ensure everyoneâ€™s safety and minimize the risk of spreading the virus
- Create job opportunities to reduce the unemployment rate and enhance the economy
    - Food packaging within supermarkets
    - Delivery people within our company
- Help local small businesses

# Website
This is the first website I built after learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Although it was challenging to create a landing page from scratch, I learned a lot about how to implement different features that I had usually taken for granted.  
- Responsiveness
    - Some pictures would be hidden to prevent too much scrolling
    - A toggler would appear on the navbar instead if the screen is too small
    - Breakpoints and containers are used to make sure each section is presented with enough spacing
- Form Validation
    - I followed [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GsKEtBcGTk) to implement form vaildation along with the basis of the login page
- Meta Tags
    - I used the Open Graph Meta Tags so the website would appear better when posted on social media
- Animation
    - There are animation to indicate when the user is hovering on links, navbar tabs, or buttons
    - Different sections fades in as the user scrolls

## Assets 
Picture, illustration, and icons are found from
- [unDraw](https://undraw.co/illustrations)
- [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/) 
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

## Tools
Those are the libraries that I had used for this website 
- [Google Chart](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs)
    - This is used to create the `Civilian unemployment rate` chart in the product page
    - I utilized the `option` variable to customize the chart in order to fit the theme of the website more
- [Animation On Scroll](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/)
    - This creates different animations for the website as the user scroll through the website. 
    - There are also custom event listeners that allowed me to do different operations after the animation. 
        - The `Civilian unemployment rate` chart would start its animation again whenever the chart is faded in as the user scrolls
        - The highlight under texts would only appear after the animation is complete
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
    - This framework helped made the website more responsive
    - I had referenced various built-in features in the website including
        - Breakpoints
        - Cards
        - Modals
        - Navigation Bar
            - Dropdown menu
            - Toggler
